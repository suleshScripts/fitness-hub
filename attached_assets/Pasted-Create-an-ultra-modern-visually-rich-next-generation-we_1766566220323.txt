Create an ultra-modern, visually rich, next-generation website for a premium gym called “S Square Fitness Club.”
The website must feel cinematic, energetic, bold, and futuristic, designed for the new generation.
This is NOT a basic website — it should feel like a brand experience.

🎥 VISUAL & MOTION REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use high-quality videos and bold imagery heavily throughout the site

Use scroll-based animations (parallax, fade-ins, slide-ups, text reveals)

Every major scroll section should feel visually unique

Animate text on entry (split text, fade, slide, scale)

Smooth transitions between sections

Subtle motion on buttons, cards, and CTAs

Sticky navigation with animated hover states

The user should feel energy and motivation just by scrolling.
